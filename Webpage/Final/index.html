      <h3 align="middle">Toon shader</h3>
        <p>
          We created a shader with discrete brightness levels by editting the phong shader in order to get flat colors with different levels of RGB value. In addition, we added rim lighting in order to draw the outline of the objects, which makes them look more like animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing with the reference, we edited the texture shader on top of single-color toon shader to put in textures as shades, and made it so that the texture displayed as a flat image parallel to the plane.
        </p>   
        <table style="width:100%">
          <tbody><tr align="center">

      <h3 align="middle">Hatching shader</h3>
        <p>
          We first utilized the Phong lighting model to calculate diffuse and specular lighting contributions based on the light position, camera position, surface normal, and view direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we sampled from multiple tonal art maps at different mipmap levels, depending on the brightness values computed from the lighting calculations. We interpolated between two nearest levels to ensure smooth transitions between different levels of mipmap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing with the reference, we implemented a simplified version of the tonal blending technique, focusing on blending between textures based on brightness values rather than a comprehensive 6-way blend. Since GLSL only allow 4 textures imported, we restrict our levels to 4 only. In addition, it's hard to find tonal art maps with high resolution online. Hence, we used pure white as a part of mipmaps.

        <h3 align="middle">Watercolor simulation shader</h3>
        <p>
          We achieve a watercolor-like effect by modeling the movement of water and pigments. Each pixel of the input image is thought of as a group of paper fibers, which have an absorbency, water and pigment content, etc. Each pixel communicates with its neighbors, which allows us to model diffusion effects of the watercolor. 
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/watercolor1/pixel_diagram.png" alt="Example GIF" style="width: 30%;">
                <figcaption>Pixel communication structure</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>

        <p> Each timestep of our simulation consists of the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Surface tension: The water and pigments on the surface of the paper experience surface tension, which is an attraction force. Let W_s be a $w * h$ array of the water levels at each pixel, and P_s be a $w * h * 3$ array of the pigment CMY levels at each pixel. 

                For surface tension in the horizontal direction, we have
                \[D_x = s * \frac{W[i][j+1] - W[i][j]}{W[i][j]}\]
                \[D_y = s * \frac{W[i+1][j] - W[i][j]}{W[i][j]}\]

                Where $D_x$ is the percentage of water/pigment content to transport right, and $s$ is the constant of surface tension. A negative value represents transport left. Similarly for $D_y$.</li>
                <li>Gravity: The water and pigments on the surface of the paper experience gravity, which disperses them. We achieve this by a convolution with the filter 

                    \[
                        \begin{bmatrix}
                        g/8 & g/8 & g/8 \\
                        g/8 & 1-g & g/8 \\
                        g/8 & g/8 & g/8 \\
                        \end{bmatrix}
                    \]

                This captures how each pixel's water and pigment content is blended with its neighbors'. Here, $g$ is a gravitational constant. We apply this convolution to $W_s$, as well as to each channel of $P_s$.
                </li>
                <li>Paper absorption: In our simulation, the canvas gradually absorbs the water and pigments, locking them into place. Let $A$ be a $w * h$ array of absorbancy values, $W_i$ and $P_i$ be the water and pigment content infused in the paper. We have 
                    \[D = k * A * W_s\]
                where $D$ is the water transported from the surface to the paper. A similar equation governs the transport of each pigment.
                </li>
            </ol>

            To render the final image, we take the RGB values of our paper texture and subtract the CMY pigment values. The paper texture adds an artistic touch to our result.
        </p>

        <p>
            This watercolor shader was heavily inspired by "Modeling Watercolor by Simulating Diffusion, Pigment, and Paper Fibers" by David Small. While our concepts are similar, some equations governing the simulation and all code are original. In particular, we modeled the effect of gravity by a convolution, while Small had a constant force pulling towards the bottom-right corner of the paper. We additionally vectorized all of the operations for efficiency.
